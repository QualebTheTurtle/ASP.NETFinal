# ASP.NET MVC Tutorial Morosko Final

## Intro to MVC

### What is MVC????
> MVC stands for Model View Controler. It is an archetectural pattern, or a way to logically organize and structure programs. MVC is not a framework, however it is commonly used by many frameworks such as Ruby on Rails and django. With MVC your program is orgamized in such a way that the Model is anything pertaining to the data of your program, being properties and databases. Views are anything pertaining to the "stuff" put out to the users screen. Finally Controller is for anything pertaining to processing information from user gathering info from the Model and View to create the final view and output to the user.
>#### MVC With ASP.NET And Web Development
>MVC can be related to the client server model in Web development. The user (you at your house) makes a request to a server, that server then requests information to a dataserver. The data server sends the requested information back and the server compiles a veiw to send to the user.

>The senario above Is the same model with MVC applied where the user makes a request. The server controls the request, and gathers information from the model. The server then generates a view and reterns it to the user.

### Lets Get to It
Now that you understand the basics of MVC lets try to enforce MVC by creating an ASP.net web application using MVC. Were going to recreate the dog lab from earlier in the semester, but using MVC. To start open up Visual Studio and click file new Project, or press Ctrl+Shift+N.

Fom there, in the left pane select templates, visual C#, finally web 

![alt text][img3]

Within the dialog box select the option circled below and name the project "DogzRRuff" in the text box at the bottom, and click Ok.

At this point thing's may not seem that unusual untill the teplate dialog box. Just select MVC from the options in the top pane and if you know git source control feel free to checkmark that box in the bottom right. You may also have host in the cloud checked, uncheck it. Click Ok to continue.

Stright away we can see that Visual Studio has autogenerated a multitude of files and folders for us. Notice the Model, Views and Controller folders.

MVC in Visual studio comes with alot of pre-built view's. Including login features and starting pages for home, about and contact. To start, lets run the code and take a look at what comes pre-built. To do this type Ctrl+F5.

![alt text][img7]

Lets change the "Application name" homepage link in the top left to say DogzRRuff. To change the text for that open the solution explorer go to veiws and shared and open the \_Layout.cshtml. This is a Razor file. Raxor files end in .cshtml or .vbhtml and they are a mixture of C# or VB and HTML tags. Edit line 6 to 

```cshtml
@Html.ActionLink("DogzRRuff", "Index", "Home", new { area = "" }, new { @class = "navbar-brand" })
```

Once edited hit Ctrl+Shift+B to rebuild the solution. Go to your web browser and refresh. From here we will change the words in our title and footer to reflect our new application name. Change lines 6 to
```cshtml
<title>@ViewBag.Title - DogzRRuff</title>
```
and 36 to
```cshtml
<p>&copy; @DateTime.Now.Year - DogzRRuff</p>
```
